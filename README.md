# React + Vite + MongoDB + Tailwind

This website serves as a data management tool that allows users to view, search, sort, filter, and edit parking zone data. It provides a user-friendly, interactive table interface for efficient data handling. The technology stack involved includes React as the main framework for building the user interface, Vite as the development build tool for fast and optimized builds, and Material-UI (MUI) or Shadcn-ui for modern, responsive, and feature-rich component styling. Additionally, Tailwind CSS may be used for further custom styling, enhancing the visual design and responsiveness of the application.
